A useful little ESP32 board. Other smaller boards could be substituted. Larger ESP32
boards could be used but would probably require a larger case. Waveshare parts
are widely available.

## Neo 7M GPS receiver

External antenna option useful to get a signal indoors. A compatible antenna will
probably be abailable from eBay.

## HT16K33 4 digit LED display

Available from the usual suspects including eBay.

## 1.9", 170x320 pixel TFT display

Available from Aliexpress & eBay. Other similar sized displays might work. If you're 
not using the same part as me, you will need to edit User_Setup.h to suit.

## BH1750 light sensor

## ClosedCube HDC1080 temperature & humidity sensor

Available from eBay in UK. Might be difficult to source outside UK and can be easily substituted with other I2C sensors. Just avoid the hopelessly inaccurate DHT11. 
Edit Sensors.cpp to suit your sensor.

## Adafruit Perma-Proto Small Mint Tin Size Breadboard PCB

Other solderable breadboards can be substituted.

## Female headers

## 10cm/4" Male to Female DuPont cables

## No2 x 13mm self tapping screws

If you're using my case design.
